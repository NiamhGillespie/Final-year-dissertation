%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
    Every abstract follows a similar pattern. Motivate; set aims; describe work; explain results.
    \vskip 0.5em
    ``XYZ is bad. This project investigated ABC to determine if it was better. 
    ABC used XXX and YYY to implement ZZZ. This is particularly interesting as XXX and YYY have
    never been used together. It was found that  
    ABC was 20\% better than XYZ, though it caused rabies in half of subjects.''

ADD IN ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS HERE, 
Peggy and all the developers who took part in my pilot study and user evaluation - feedback was invaluable.

%% Notes on formatting
%==============================================================================
% The first page, abstract and table of contents are numbered using Roman numerals and are not
% included in the page count. 
%
% From now on pages are numbered
% using Arabic numerals. Therefore, immediately after the first call to \chapter we need the call
% \pagenumbering{arabic} and this should be called once only in the document. 
%
% Do not alter the bibliography style.
%
% The first Chapter should then be on page 1. You are allowed 40 pages for a 40 credit project and 30 pages for a 
% 20 credit report. This includes everything numbered in Arabic numerals (excluding front matter) up
% to but excluding the appendices and bibliography.
%
% You must not alter text size (it is currently 10pt) or alter margins or spacing.
%
%
%==================================================================================================================================
%
% IMPORTANT
% The chapter headings here are **suggestions**. You don't have to follow this model if
% it doesn't fit your project. Every project should have an introduction and conclusion,
% however.

%  APPENDICES  

\begin{appendices}

\chapter{Appendices}

Typical inclusions in the appendices are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Copies of ethics approvals (required if obtained)
\item
  Copies of questionnaires etc. used to gather data from subjects.
\item
  Extensive tables or figures that are too bulky to fit in the main body of
  the report, particularly ones that are repetitive and summarised in the body.

\item Outline of the source code (e.g. directory structure), or other architecture documentation like class diagrams.

\item User manuals, and any guides to starting/running the software.

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Don't include your source code in the appendices}. It will be
submitted separately.
